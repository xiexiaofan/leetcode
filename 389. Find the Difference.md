## Approach #1
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int dict[26] = {0};
        for (char ch : s) ++dict[ch - 'a'];
        for (char ch : t)
            if (--dict[ch - 'a'] < 0)
                return ch;
        return 'a' - 1;  // that's mean not found
    }
};
