# 191. Number of 1 Bits

## Description
>Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation `00000000000000000000000000001011`, so the function should return 3.

## Approach #2
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (n) {
            cnt += n&1;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

## Approach #2
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (n) {
            n &= (n-1);
            ++cnt;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
