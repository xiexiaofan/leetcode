# 136. Single Number

## Description
>Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

`Note:`
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

## Approach #1 异或运算：b = a ^ b ^ a
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ret = 0;
        std::for_each(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [&ret](int num){ret ^= num;});
        return ret;
    }
};
```
