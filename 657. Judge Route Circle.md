# 657. Judge Route Circle

## Description
>Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to **the original place.**

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are `R` (Right), `L` (Left), `U` (Up) and `D` (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.    

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: "LL"
Output: false
```

## Approach #1
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeCircle(string moves) {
        int arr[2] = {0};
        for (char c : moves) {
            if (c == 'R') arr[0]++;
            if (c == 'U') arr[1]++;
            if (c == 'L') arr[0]--;
            if (c == 'D') arr[1]--;
        }
        return !arr[0] && !arr[1];
    }
};
```
