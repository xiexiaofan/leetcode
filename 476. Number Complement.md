# 476. Number Complement
## Description
>Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

**Note:**

- The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
- You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

## Approach #1
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        int tmp = num;
        int len = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        for ( ; tmp!=0; tmp>>=1, ++sum)  sum <<= 1;
        return sum&(~num);
    }
};
```

## Approach #2
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        unsigned mask = ~0;
        while (num & mask) mask <<= 1;
        return ~mask & ~num;
    }
};
```
