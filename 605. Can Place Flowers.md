# 605. Can Place Flowers
## Description
>Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.    

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
```

**Note:**

- The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
- The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
- n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.


## Approach #1
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int len = flowerbed.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
            bool pre = i== 0 || flowerbed[i-1]==0;
            bool cur = flowerbed[i]==0;
            bool nxt = i+1==len || flowerbed[i+1]==0;
            if (pre && cur && nxt) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                ++cnt;
            }
        }
        return cnt >= n;
    }
};
```
