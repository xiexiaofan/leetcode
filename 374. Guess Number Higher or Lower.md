# 374. Guess Number Higher of Lower
## Description
>We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:    

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.      
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.       
You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results `(-1, 1, or 0)`:   

```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

**Example:** 
```
n = 10, I pick 6.
Return 6.
```

## Approach #1
```C++
// Forward declaration of guess API.
// @param num, your guess
// @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
int guess(int num);

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int maxNumber = n, minNumber = 1;
        while (true) {
            int meanNumber = (maxNumber - minNumber) / 2 + minNumber;
            int res = guess(meanNumber);
            if (res == 0) { 
                return meanNumber;
            } else if (res == 1) {
                minNumber = meanNumber + 1;
            } else {
                maxNumber = meanNumber - 1;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
