# 70. Climbing Stairs
## Description
>You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

`Note:` Given n will be a positive integer.

## Approach #1 
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        vector<int> dp;
        dp.reserve(n+1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i)
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];   // key point
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
