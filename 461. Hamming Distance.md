# 461. Hamming Distance
## Description
>The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.    

**Note:**    
0 ≤ `x`, `y` < 231.

**Example:**    
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

## Approach #1
```C++
class Solution {
// 借助逻辑运算符
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int tmp = x ^ y;
        int ret = 0;
        while (tmp) {
            ret += (tmp & 1);
            tmp >>= 1 ;
        }
        return ret;
    }
};
```
