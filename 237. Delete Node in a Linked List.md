#  237. Delete Node in a Linked List

## Description
>Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` and you are given the third node with value `3`, the linked list should become `1 -> 2 -> 4` after calling your function.

## Approach #1 
```C++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        *node = *(node->next);
    }
};
```
